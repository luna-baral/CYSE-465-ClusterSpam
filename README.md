# CYSE-Project-4
This project is for the CYSE 465 project 4.This is a project done on Autoware to create an attack on the perception stack created on the remote desktop.
For this assignment, my groupmates and I set out to set out a man-in-the-middle attack.

We have tried packet flooding in the Wireshark to orchestrate the attack, however, it did not go through. I have here attached the various python scripts that we utilized for the packet flooding including the ones that did not work.
