# CYSE-Project-4
This project is for the CYSE 465 project 4.This is a project done on Autoware to create an attack on the perception stack created on the remote desktop.
For this assignment, my groupmates and I set out to set out a man-in-the-middle attack.

We have tried packet flooding in the Wireshark to orchestrate the attack, however, it did not go through. I have here attached the various python scripts that we utilized for the packet flooding including the ones that did not work.

I worked on the running the remote desktop with Melanie Brown to run the commands and the wireshark.

studied the techniques used for the attack, researched on the tcp packet flooding and how to implement it, brainstormed with the team on the best ways to carry out the attack, attended session to orchestrate the attacks, simulation operator for the practice stage.Worked on the strength and weakness/countermeasure of the attack.
